This started with the code from the nice person here:
https://hackaday.io/project/5301/logs

It's meant to graph the data from a TFA Dostmann USB CO2/Temperature monitor.

To Install:

	+ aptitude install python-numpy python-matplotlib
	+ install udev rules
	+ udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger

TODO:
 + maybe just pass time objects instead of doing the timestamp conversions dance in the plot func
 + using a fixed number of points leads to wide differences in the amount of data graphed, even between insturments of the same make and model.
